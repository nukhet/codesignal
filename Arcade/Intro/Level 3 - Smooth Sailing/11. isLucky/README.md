# isLucky
Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.

### Example
- For n = 1230, the output should be
isLucky(n) = true;
- For n = 239017, the output should be
isLucky(n) = false.

### Input/Output

- **[input] integer n** A ticket number represented as a positive integer with an even number of digits.

- **Guaranteed constraints:** 10 ≤ n < 106.

- **[output] boolean** true if n is a lucky ticket number, false otherwise.
