# reverseParentheses
You have a string s that consists of English letters, punctuation marks, whitespace characters, and brackets. It is guaranteed that the parentheses in s form a regular bracket sequence.

Your task is to reverse the strings contained in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost pair. The results string should not contain any parentheses.

### Example

- For string s = "a(bc)de", the output should be
reverseParentheses(s) = "acbde".
